and data organization</a>,
and have spent the last year working to defeat Donald Trump and win back the senate for the Democrats.</span><br><span>At Hawkfish, my work has focused on voter engagement and persuasion: building voter models for use in
audience generation, conducting randomized controlled trials and observational studies to identify the best ad
content and settings, and <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03461>Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) Modeling</a>
to identify which individuals are persuaded most strongly by particular ads.</span><br></div><div class=introduction><h4>Example Projects from the Past Year</h4><ul><li><a href class=project>Bayesian Hypothesis Testing API</a>
<span class=project_description>As part of the Experiments team for the Mike Bloomberg 2020 Campaign, I
built our hypothesis testing tool <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02769.pdf>using a Bayesian approach</a>. The team
deployed sets of ads in a Randomized Controlled Trial setting and wanted to know which ad(s) drove the highest
rates of conversion (clicks, email submission, form completion, etc.). The tool modeled conversion rates using
the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution>beta distribution</a>, enabling fast Bayesian updating, and
producing results that were easy to interpret by a broad audience (e.g. &lsquo;probability of being best&rsquo; versus p-values).
I deployed the API on <a href=https://kubernetes.io/>kubernetes</a> using
<a href=https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/>flask</a>.</span></li><li><a href class=project>Voter Modeling to Predict Registration, Voting By Mail, and Voting Early</a>
<span class=project_description>In the early summer I built a number of voter models to predict the probability of individuals
(1) registering to vote in the coming months, (2) voting by mail, and (3) voting early, in order to inform audience
generation and ad targeting. The models used the
<a href=https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>XGBoost gradient boosted trees algorithm</a> to fit over 1,000 distinct voter
features. I deployed the models on Hawkfish&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.kubeflow.org/>Kubeflow</a> machine learning platform, using
<a href=https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/katib/overview/>Katib</a> for parallelized hyperparameter tuning, and
<a href=https://argoproj.github.io/>Argo</a> to score the country&rsquo;s 257 million eligible voters. The voter registration scores
were used by registration efforts that registered more voters in AZ, GA, MI, PA, and WI than were the margins of difference
in those states.</span></li><li><a href class=project>Causal Inference of Observational Data with Bootstrapped Logistic Regression</a>
<span class=project_description>Causal inference is best done in a
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-009-9450-2#:~:text=Randomized%20controlled%20trials%20(RCTs)%20are,the%20outcome%E2%80%94in%20the%20experiment.">randomized controlled trial (RCT) setting</a>,
but there are times when a full RCT set up isn&rsquo;t practical or possible. To assess ad performance as best we could outside of RCTs,
I built a logistic regression framework that
<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4017459/>controlled for potentially confounding variables</a> like viewer age,
time of day, site domain, and other factors, and isolated the effect of ad content on engagement metrics like view completion
and click through rates. I deployed the framework on Kubeflow which, given its ability to deploy hundreds of runs in parallel, enabled
<a href=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading24.pdf>boostrap sampling to generate confidence intervals</a>.
Kubeflow also enabled running many conditional settings in parallel, so we could see how ads performed across audiences as a whole and also
within different demographic buckets.</span></li></ul></div><div class=introduction><h4>Personal</h4><span>Prior to my career as a data scientist, I spent nine years working in venture capital building
seed-stage companies in the biofuels, water treatment, radioactive waste remediation, mining, and sustainable
packaging industries.</span><br><span>I&rsquo;m active in a number of organizations throughout New York City, including the <a href=https://www.nyrr.org/>New York Road
Runners</a> where I&rsquo;m a member of the executive committee of the board of directors, chair
of the development committee, and vice-chair of the public affairs committee, the
<a href=https://centralparktc.org/>Central Park Track Club</a>, of which I was president from 2008 to 2017 and currently serve
on the board, and the <a href=https://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/about/about-brooklyn-bridge-park-conservancy/>Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy</a>,
where I&rsquo;m also a board member.</span><br><span>I was a competitive runner back in the day and was the first Brooklyn resident and 46th overall finisher in the
2011 New York City Marathon, finishing in 2:29:46. That was a long time ago and now I get winded chasing after my kids.
I live with my wife and two boys in Brooklyn.</span><br></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div><a href=https://github.com/hadisinaee/avicenna>Avicenna Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div><script>feather.replace()</script></body></html>
